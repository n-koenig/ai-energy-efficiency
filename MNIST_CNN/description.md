# Simple MNIST CNN
- cnn, implemented in pytorch and keras, trained on mnist

## hyperparameters
- 12 epochs, batch size 128


## pinpoint 
- 20 runs each, through benchmark.py
- -i 500, -a 8000, -b 8000


## results/learnings:
- pytorch much more energy
- pytorch much better accuracy
- keras better (linear) efficiency

- measurements after PC restart, no programs opened, no specific power settings used
